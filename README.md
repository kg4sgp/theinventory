# theinventory
An attempt at making a custom inventory app among friends in our spare time.

Thoughts on Requirements
========================

* Optical code scanner (Bar code and QR code)
* Pictures of items
* Inventory recheck function (make sure everything is accounted for)
* Rating system for items (color and shape coded)
* Custom tags/categories for items (location, DVDs, games etc)
* Exportable to spread sheet
* Items history in inventory?
* Info query on item
* Multi-user access to inventory
